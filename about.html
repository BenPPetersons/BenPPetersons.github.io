    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p class="centerText">I have worked as a soccer referee for 2 years in Wisconsin before moving to North Carolina in the summer of 2019. I have been employed at Lowes Foods (grocery store) since March 2021, and have learned valuable workplace skills such as customer interaction and working with co workers. I have been using the Adobe Suite since late 2019, and primarily use Adobe Premiere Pro, Illustrator, Photoshop, and InDesign. However, I am not Adobe certified in these fields due to COVID-19 closing testing opportunities, and the testing platform not working properly. I am also an avid computer enthusiast, and love pretty much anything computers. I have taken apart and rebuilt my computer a few times, and have learned how to react to computer errors(even have a Raspberry Pi, a mini computer that runs Linux, but not too experienced with it). I have a little under a year in Python experience, with JavaScript experience as well in CS classes. I am hoping to pursue a degree for some form of Computer Science, and I am open for any kind of internship or experience building job related to that field. I am currently a senior at Panther Creek High School, and am participating in Deca, TSA, and other clubs. I also play soccer as well, and I am a captain of the soccer team and received the awards for 1st team all conference and 1st team all region.</p>
